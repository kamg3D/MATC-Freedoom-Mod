So you don't have to download the png image. It is just there.
If my instructions are ever unclear please watch this video called "How I run DOOM MODS | ZDL Tutorial + CUSTOM Mod Gameplay" by NZ Dennis to get a better understanding.

Downloading Doom and DOOM 2 is optional 
For Doom and DOOM 2 just store your WADS in the same folder you keep GZDOOM. You can click and drag them onto GZDOOM.exe to open and play.
